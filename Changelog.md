* **Console Output Display in Editor**   
When you test your scripts in the Addin editor, you now can use Console output to write to the captured console window on the form. The Console displays output from your code when writing to the Console, as well as displaying compiler and runtime error messages.

* **Errors can now optionally open Compiled Source**  
When a compilation error occurs during script execution you can now optionally pop open a new Markdown Monster editor window with the full compiled source code. You can match error line numbers to code lines.

### 0.1

* **Add Keyboard Hotkey Support**  
You can now bind a keyboard hotkey to your Script so you can invoke it from within the editor. Hotkeys take the format of Alt-Shift-N, Ctrl+Alt+F1 etc.
